# Sebastián — Junior NOC / Monitoring (Linux)

I’m building a small Home NOC Lab on Debian and documenting incident response (runbooks + tickets).

## Target roles
- NOC Junior / Monitoring Operator
- Infra Support N1 (Linux)

## What I practice
- Linux triage: systemd, logs (journalctl), disk/CPU/memory
- Network checks: DNS vs connectivity vs ports
- Documentation: runbooks + ticket-style notes

## Projects
- Home NOC Lab: https://github.com/seba-stulle/home-noc-lab
- Runbooks: https://github.com/seba-stulle/noc-runbooks
